## Key Objectives of Project
I use Databricks to upload my dataset and connect it with VS Code by using a microservice(FastAPI) and command-line tool(click). The goal of my project is showing Walmart weekly sales that includes holidays or non-holidays. It will help managers to check weekly sales based on holiday element. 

## Dataset Source
Walmart, one of the leading retail stores in the US, it is also my favorite supermarket since I was a kid. Therefore, for my project 1, I chose a dataset from Kaggle called Walmart (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset), which is about 45 Walmart storesâ€™ historical data that covers sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. There are seven main variables:Date, Weekly_Sales, Fuel_Price, CPI, Temperature, Holiday_Flag and Unemployment rate. My project will focus on exploring the effect of holidays on weekly sales for Walmart. After analyzing this data, managers could update or fix sales strategies according to the weekly sales in each week which has holidays or non-holidays.

## Connect Codespace and Databricks
We need to create four secrets for codespace depository by copying link from databricks (DATABRICKS_HOST, DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH, DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME and DATABRICKS_TOKEN):

## Function of hi_query_sql_db
My sql query will return the weekly sales of Walmart according to weeks which have holidays or non-holidays. Once we call the querydb function, it shows the weekly sales that includes holidays when type 1, anor not include holidays when type 0. Also, it will sort the weekly sales by descending order, so that mangers can find the week which have relatively high sales quickly. Now, we need to check whether databricks and codespace has been connected by typing following code in terminal:

### databricks clusters list --output JSON | jq
### databricks fs ls dbfs:/
### databricks jobs list --output JSON | jq

## Fastapi App for Web 
Now, if we type the following code in terminal, and click "open in browser":

After that, a new web page will come up and shows a sentence below:

Then, if we type "/query" at the end of the url address, it will return the weekly sales for weeks with holidays automatically:
